# [Natural Recipes](http://github/erinlorelle/naturalrecipes) 

A [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) template from  was chosen as a basis for my first website project.  This was a project to demonstrate what I learned in the short 2 month course.  Using Bootstrap was not required, but was used to create a better looking site.

The website contains recipes for natural home and beauty care as an alternative to commercial products.

* Run the index.html file on the local host by selecting Run in [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) and then selecting your preferred browser.  Google and Firefox are preferred.

## Bugs and Issues

The Logo in the header isn't responsive to different screen sizes.  This was intentionally left uncorrected to maintain authenticity of the website.
